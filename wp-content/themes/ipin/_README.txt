Installation

While Wordpress offers a way to upload the theme via WP-Admin > Appearance, sometimes the file permissions are not set correctly.

It is recommended to upload with an FTP client e.g Filezilla.

1. Unpack the zip file

2. FTP upload the 'ipin' folder to the '/wp-content/themes' directory, 
   such that style.css can be found at /wp-content/themes/ipin/style.css

3. Check that all theme files have permission of 644/666 and folders have permission of 755/777

4. Login to Wordpress admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and activate the iPin theme

5. Go to Appearance > iPin Settings to configure theme
