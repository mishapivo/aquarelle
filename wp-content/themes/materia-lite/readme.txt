## Description

Materia Lite is an elegant, responsive, material design inspired PremiumÂ WordPress Theme. Perfect for for blogging as well as modern or tech oriented websites as well as portfolio and business websites.

It features two widgetizable areas in the sidebar and the optional footer, two custom menu locations in the navbar and footer, optional tagline display, custom logo, custom colors, custom header image and custom background.

Materia Lite is the lite version of Materia Pro, which comes with many additional features and access to premium class pro support forum and can be found at https://www.iceablethemes.com

### Getting started with Materia Lite

* Once you activate the theme from your WordPress admin panel, you can visit the customizer (Appearance > Customize) to set your own logo, header image, background, menus etc.
* If you will be using a custom header image, you will find options to enable or disable it on your homepage, blog index pages, single post pages and individual pages.
* If you select the "dropdown" option for in Mobile > mobile menu, make sure to set a menu yourself, instead of relying on the default menu. Doing so will ensure the dropdown version of your menu works properly in responsive mode.
* You can also set a custom menu at the bottom right of your site. Note this footer menu doesn't support sub-menus, only top-level menu items will be displayed.
* Footer widgets: The widgetizable footer is disabled by default. To activate it, simply go to Appearance > Widgets and drop some widgets in the "Footer" area, just like you would do for the sidebar. It is recommended to use 4 widgets in the footer, or no widgets at all to disable it.
* Additional documentation and free support forums can be found at https://www.iceablethemes.com under "support".
