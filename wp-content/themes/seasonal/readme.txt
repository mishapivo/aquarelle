* How do I change Styles or Modify the Theme?

You have a couple options available, but 

1. Making "only" stylesheet (CSS) changes, you can use a plugin for editing CSS
2. To make CSS and/or modify the theme files, it's recommended to use a child theme so that you can keep your original theme up to date without losing your modifications/changes.

This theme includes a premade child theme that you can find in your theme's original download package.
