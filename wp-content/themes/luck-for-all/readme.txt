Short description: Luck For All theme is a Child theme for Twenty Twelve with Some Design changes and a New Blog Layout.

== Description ==

Twenty Twelve is one of my most favourite default themes. However, I often have to make frequent changes to the design and code of the theme. As a result I arrived at Luck for all theme. I got lucky and created this beautiful theme.

* Centered Header Layout
* A Simpler Layout to display posts on Homepage with a Small Thumbnail, Title and Excerpt.
* Minor Changes to Sidebar Design. All Widgets have clear margins due to a darker background.
* Created an Option to Have Separate Menu in Footer. You can use this for items like Privacy Policy, About Us, Terms of Service, etc.
* Minor UI Changes to Primary Menu. Items are now Center aligned, with light borders around them.
* There is no option to add a Logo in Twenty Twelve theme. This Child theme solves that problem, and gives you an option to upload a logo via Customizer.
