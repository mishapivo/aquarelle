        - The Mobile Menu is slightly different from other themes. I have created a mobile menu that is at 
          the bottom left corner that helps users to navigation easier. The reason why is that 90% of users 
          when using their device, their hands are always at the bottom of the screen which kind of makes 
          the mobile menu more sense to have it at the bottom left corner. The Menu itself when is not set, 
          the Site Title and Tagline will move to the center, if set, the Site Title and Tagline will move
          to the left while the menu is at the right side.
